				This opera is as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety.
				You can not just have your characters announce how they feel. That
				makes me feel angry! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to
				experience Frys worm infested bowels as if you were actually
				wriggling through them. I just told you! You have killed me! Fry! Quit
				doing the right thing, you jerk! Michelle, I do not regret this, but
				I both rue and lament it. Morbo can not understand his teleprompter
				because he forgot how you say that letter that is shaped like a man
				wearing a hat.
